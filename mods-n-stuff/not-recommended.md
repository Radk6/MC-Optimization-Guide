## List of mods that aren't recommended for one reason or another. May change in the future.
This list assumes that you're already using every mod this guide recommends. Furthermore, just because a mod is on this list doesn't mean it's bad. Many of them are great, but they've either been replaced by a better mod or are redundant with something recommended by this guide.
