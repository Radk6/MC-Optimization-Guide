## VFX Stack

Angelica isn't the only rendering performance mod for 1.7.10. There is another option, the so called "VFX Stack". It includes:

| Mod | Notes | Client/Server |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Beddium | - | Client |
| FalseTweaks | - | Client |
| NotFine | - | Client |

There are pros and cons of using VFX Stack mods over Angelica:

Pros:
- Beddium is based on a newer version of Sodium (0.5.11 vs 0.2), likely has better performance.
- Better mod support
- Better period-appropriate shader support (via SwanSong Shaders)

Cons:
- No Sodium video settings UI (currently)
- Requires additional mods to get the same functionality as Angelica (SwanSong Shaders, RightProperMCPatcher and NotFine)

As for which one is better for you, try it and see.
