# A short note on OptiFine
As you may have noticed, OptiFine is not present on any of the lists. Now, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1bjc5mc/is_there_a_reason_why_people_still_use_optifine/) [topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/17qij4g/is_optifine_that_bad_nowadays/) [has](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/187djkg/what_is_up_with_optifine_and_why_does_it_get_so/) [been](https://web.archive.org/web/20201029070752/https://gist.github.com/jellysquid3/e46882e37907dfbb3d03d26f589b1c6a/) [beaten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqXF4GgP9e0) [to](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/wyyymx/stop_using_optifine_goddamit/) [death](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/12qpidr/is_optifine_that_bad/), so I'll just list the reasons why:

- Terrible mod compatibility in 1.16+
- No native support for Fabric or NeoForge [[1]](https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/issues/2429) [[2]](https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/issues/7626)
- Bugs. [OptiFine's issue tracker has over 2.6K open issues](https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/issues), oldest of which date back to 2016.
- It tends to increase loading times, especially in modded environments [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/o6tbhr/optifine_and_loading_times/) [[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/nd29v5/does_optifine_slow_the_load_time_for_anyone/)
- It takes really long to update to newer versions of Minecraft
- There are better performance boosting mods out there 
- Some of its' features can break certain game mechanics (for example Fast Math or Smooth World) [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Optifine/comments/13l8vxe/does_fast_rended_and_fast_math_break_world_gen/) [[2]](https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/issues/5583) [[3]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/4m9o6m/psa_if_you_are_planning_to_use_optifine_in_a/)
- Some shaders are dropping OptiFine support in favor of Iris.
